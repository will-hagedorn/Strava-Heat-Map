# Strava-Heat-Map
API to request Strava activity data to create a heat map.

Running the map.py script will make the API request to Strava and use folium to make the heat map and save it into index.html. Running index.html yields the heat map. 
Directions for adapting this to one's own Strava data is under progress.
